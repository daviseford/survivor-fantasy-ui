 * Isolated auth-flow e2e. Unlike playwright.trades.config.ts, this suite never
 * touches production: the Vite dev server runs in `e2e-auth` mode
 * (.env.e2e-auth + emulator wiring in src/firebase.ts), so Auth, Firestore,
 * and Realtime Database all talk to local Firebase emulators under the
 * inert `demo-auth-flows` project. Run it through the emulator wrapper:
 *
 *   yarn e2e:auth-flows
 *
 * One worker: tests share the emulator and flush/reseed it between tests
 * (see e2e/auth-flows.spec.ts), so parallel workers would race.
