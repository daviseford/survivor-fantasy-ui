/**
 * Security-rules tests for per-competition team names.
 *
 * Participants can set only their own `team_names` entry on a competition doc
 * and nothing else. The creator keeps update rights over the rest of the doc
 * but, like any participant, may rename only their own team; only an admin
 * may rename another participant's team. These rules are the only server-side
 * control -- the edit UI only ever offers the participant's own name, but a
 * client calling the SDK directly skips that entirely.
 *
 * Run with `yarn test:rules` (starts the Firestore emulator).
