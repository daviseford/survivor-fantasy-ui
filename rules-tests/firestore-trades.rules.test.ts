/**
 * Security-rules tests for the trades subcollection.
 *
 * These rules are the ONLY server-side control on a feature that moves
 * scoring-relevant assets between users: the app's own `validateTrade` runs in
 * the browser and a participant calling the Firestore SDK directly skips it
 * entirely. The live e2e suite only drives the valid UI path, so it cannot
 * catch a rule that has become too permissive -- it would still pass green.
 *
 * Run with `yarn test:rules` (starts the Firestore emulator).
