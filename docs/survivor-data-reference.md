# survivoR Data Reference

Data source: [doehm/survivoR](https://github.com/doehm/survivoR) R package (`dev/json/`)

Base URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doehm/survivoR/master/dev/json/{table}.json`

All tables return JSON arrays. Most tables have `version` (filter to `"US"`) and `season` fields. The `castaway_id` field (format `US0001`) is the universal join key across tables. For how the automated CI pipeline fetches, transforms, and syncs this data, see [CI Auto-Sync Pipeline](solutions/workflow-issues/ci-auto-sync-pipeline-validation-and-formatting-fix.md).

## Transformation Rules

### Finale Detection

An episode should only be marked as the finale (`isFinale: true`) if a winner has been declared for the season (i.e., `castaways.winner === true` for at least one castaway). If no winner exists in the data, the season is still in progress and no episode should be flagged as the finale — even if it is the highest-numbered episode.

## Known Data Gaps

These are things survivoR does NOT track that our app scores:

| Scoring Event                                      | Why unavailable                                                                                          | Supplement                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `use_shot_in_the_dark_successfully/unsuccessfully` | Available on newer seasons via `vote_history.vote_event` + `vote_event_outcome`, but not across all eras | Derive from `vote_history`                 |
| `votes_negated_by_idol` (with count)               | `votes_nullified` field missing on most seasons                                                          | Derive from `vote_history.nullified` count |
| Some individual camp challenges                    | survivoR only tracks challenges with challenge_id                                                        | Manual entry                               |

## Name Format Differences

survivoR uses preferred/stage names rather than full legal names:

| survivoR      | Wiki/Firestore            |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `Coach Wade`  | `Benjamin "Coach" Wade`   |
| `Q Burdette`  | `Quintavius "Q" Burdette` |
| `Oscar Lusth` | `Ozzy Lusth`              |

The `castaway_details.json` table has `full_name_detailed` which may include the legal name, but it lacks `version`/`season` fields (it's a global lookup).
